Absolutely — focusing **only on the `Ctrl Alt Del` repo** (the aging theory repository) and ignoring slides, videos, and anything unnecessary for the AI reasoning pipeline, here’s the **exact list of files and folders you need**:

---

## **Files to Keep**

1. **Structured LLM-processed theory data**

   ```
   C:\Users\NewUserName\Desktop\ctrl alt del\additional_files\stage1_5_llm_mapped.json
   ```

2. **Main enriched theory data**

   ```
   C:\Users\NewUserName\Desktop\ctrl alt del\combined_results_enriched_short.xlsx
   C:\Users\NewUserName\Desktop\ctrl alt del\combined_results_enriched_theory_stats.xlsx
   ```

3. **Strict criteria / high-confidence theory data**

   ```
   C:\Users\NewUserName\Desktop\ctrl alt del\strict_criteria_results\combined_results_REFINED_extended_REFINED.xlsx
   C:\Users\NewUserName\Desktop\ctrl alt del\strict_criteria_results\combined_results_REFINED_short_REFINED.xlsx
   C:\Users\NewUserName\Desktop\ctrl alt del\strict_criteria_results\combined_results_REFINED_theory_stats_REFINED.xlsx
   ```

---

## **Folders to Keep**

* `additional_files/` → contains `stage1_5_llm_mapped.json`
* `strict_criteria_results/` → contains all strict/refined Excel files

---

## **Folders / Files to Ignore**

* `slides_video/` → PPTX / MP4 presentation files (not needed for AI reasoning)
* Any other non-data scripts or documentation unless directly used in processing

---

✅ **Summary:** You only need **6 files** across **2 folders**:

```
Ctrl Alt Del/
├── additional_files/
│   └── stage1_5_llm_mapped.json
├── strict_criteria_results/
│   ├── combined_results_REFINED_extended_REFINED.xlsx
│   ├── combined_results_REFINED_short_REFINED.xlsx
│   └── combined_results_REFINED_theory_stats_REFINED.xlsx
├── combined_results_enriched_short.xlsx
└── combined_results_enriched_theory_stats.xlsx
```

These files give you all the structured theory definitions, scoring metrics, and high-confidence evaluations to feed into your RAG + multi-agent AI pipeline.

If you want, I can **next create a “Ctrl Alt Del → Unified JSON schema” plan**, showing exactly how to normalize all these files for your hackathon-ready knowledge graph. This will save tons of time later.

Do you want me to do that?


Yes — that’s exactly it. ✅

All **6 files** you listed are the ones you need from the `Ctrl Alt Del` repo. They cover:

1. **Structured theory definitions** → `stage1_5_llm_mapped.json`
2. **Enriched theory data** → `combined_results_enriched_short.xlsx` & `combined_results_enriched_theory_stats.xlsx`
3. **Strict / high-confidence evaluations** → the three `REFINED` Excel files

With just these, you have everything required to build your **knowledge graph, RAG embeddings, and multi-agent reasoning pipeline**.

Everything else (slides, videos, extra docs) can be ignored for now.

If you want, I can make the **next step: a unified JSON schema plan** to combine all these files neatly for your AI pipeline.
