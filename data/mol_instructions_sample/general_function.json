Involved in mediating host resistance to bacterial infection through negative regulation of type I interferon (IFN) production. In vitro, activates MAPK/ERK pathway in response to IL1 in an IRAK1-independent manner, leading to up-regulation of IL8 and CCL4. Transduces CD40 and TNFRSF1A signals that activate ERK in B-cells and macrophages, and thus may play a role in the regulation of immunoglobulin production. May also play a role in the transduction of TNF signals that activate JNK and NF-kappa-B in some cell types. In adipocytes, activates MAPK/ERK pathway in an IKBKB- dependent manner in response to IL1B and TNF, but not insulin, leading to induction of lipolysis. Plays a role in the cell cycle.
